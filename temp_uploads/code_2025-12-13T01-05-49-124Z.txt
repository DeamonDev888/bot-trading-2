     ```
     users[2]{id,name,role}:
       1,Alice,admin
       2,Bob,user
     ```
     - The `[2]` indicates the array length (optional but helpful for validation).
     - Keys are listed once in the header, followed by comma-separated values per row.
     - This reduces tokens by eliminating redundant key repetitions and structural overhead.

2. **YAML to Toon**:
   - YAML's indentation-heavy structure is flattened into Toon's tabular style. For instance, a YAML list of items becomes a compact array header with rows.

3. **CSV to Toon**:
   - CSV data (e.g., headers and rows) is directly mapped to Toon's array format, preserving delimiters and handling quoted fields.

4. **Rewriting Existing Code**:
   - Toon can refactor code snippets that embed JSON/YAML/CSV to use Toon instead, often as a drop-in replacement in prompts or data serialization logic.

### Benefits and Optimizations
- **Token Efficiency**: By condensing repetitive structures (e.g., no repeated keys in arrays), Toon minimizes the input size fed to LLMs, leading to faster processing, lower API costs, and better context utilization.
- **LLM Readability**: The tabular format aligns with how models parse structured data, reducing parsing errors and improving response accuracy.
- **Validation and Error Correction**: Built-in checks ensure data integrity; invalid structures are flagged and auto-corrected where possible.
- **Flexibility**: Supports advanced options like custom delimiters for edge cases (e.g., data with embedded commas) or key folding for deeply nested objects.
- **Performance Gains**: In practice, this can enhance model performance by allowing more data per prompt without exceeding limits.

Toon is ideal for developers working with LLM integrations, data analysts optimizing prompts, or anyone serializing structured data for AI consumption. If you have a specific JSON, YAML, or CSV example you'd like converted, or need further details on implementation, let me know.
